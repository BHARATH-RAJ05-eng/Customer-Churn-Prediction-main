This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. By analyzing customer data, we build a machine learning model to identify clients who are likely to cancel their subscriptions.

## About The Project

### Problem Statement

üéØ A telecommunications company in California was facing a challenge with customer retention. The primary goal was to leverage customer data to build a predictive model that could accurately identify customers at a high risk of churning, allowing the company to proactively take measures to retain them.

### Dataset

üìä The dataset used for this analysis is `telecom_customer_churn.csv`, which contains information on 7,043 customers across California. It includes customer demographics, account information, subscribed services, and monthly/total charges.

### Built With

This project was built using the following technologies and libraries:

* **Programming Language:** [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* **Data Analysis:** [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* **Data Visualization:** [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
* **Machine Learning:** [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system.
* Python 3.8+
* pip
    ```sh
    python -m ensurepip --upgrade
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory
    ```sh
    cd your-repo
    ```
3.  Install the required Python packages
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Project Workflow

The project followed a structured approach to solve the problem:

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for analysis.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used data visualization to uncover patterns and identify key factors influencing customer churn.
3.  **Model Building:** Trained and evaluated several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the models based on accuracy to select the best-performing one for the final prediction task.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

üîé Visual analysis revealed several key insights into the customer base and the factors driving churn.

* **Customer Base Distribution:** A look at the overall customer status shows a significant portion of customers have churned.
* **Churn by Gender:** The analysis indicates that gender does not play a significant role in the churn rate.
* **Churn by Contract Type:** This was a critical finding. Customers with a **Month-to-Month contract** have a dramatically higher churn rate compared to those with One Year or Two Year contracts, making it a powerful predictor.

## Results & Conclusion

‚ú® The final model, an **XGBoost Classifier**, proved to be the most effective for this prediction task.

üèÜ **Final Model Accuracy: 80.86%**

The model's performance is detailed in the confusion matrix, which shows its ability to correctly distinguish between customers who churned and those who stayed. This model can be a valuable tool for the company to identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies, ultimately reducing revenue loss.
